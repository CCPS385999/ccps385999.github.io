    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here? I am working on trying to go D1 for football. Some experiences that led me here were playing football while I was younger. Another experience that also led me here was watching football with my family and talking to them about it.
How am I working toward these goals? I am working out everyday with the football kids. I am also doing foot drills at home and doing pylometrics at home. I am also trying to do all my school work so my GPA get higher and so i don't have to worry about my GPA when football season comes around
What values do I consider most necessary for my success? I think dedication and putting in the effort. Another big thing is showing up and putting 110% in everything you do.  
What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future? I hope to squat 315. I also want to bench 200. And I would want to clean 250. 
What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for? I want to be know for a dedicated person. Also a person that never gives up no matter how many times i get knocked down i just get back up. </p>
